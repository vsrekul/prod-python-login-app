Using Mozilla SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) to encrypt files with a PGP key involves a few steps. Here’s how you can do it:

Prerequisites
1.Install SOPS: You can install SOPS via Homebrew (on macOS), apt (on Debian/Ubuntu), or download the binary for your operating system from the SOPS GitHub releases page.
sudo apt-get install sops

2.Install GnuPG: Ensure you have GnuPG installed to manage your PGP keys. You can install it with:
sudo apt-get install gnupg

3.Generate a PGP Key (if you don't have one):
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --list-keys

====================================================================================================================

To set up a Docker container that uses SOPS-encrypted secrets mounted as a volume and decrypts them using a PGP private key, we’ll need to alter the Dockerfile, Kubernetes secret, and deployment configuration accordingly.
Step 1: Create a PGP Encrypted Secret
First, create your secret file (e.g., secrets.yaml) and encrypt it using SOPS with your PGP key:
sops -e --pgp <your_pgp_key_id> secrets-db.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml

Step 2: Create a Kubernetes Secret
kubectl create secret generic encrypted-secrets --from-file=secrets.enc.yaml
You also need to create a Kubernetes secret for your PGP private key:
kubectl create secret generic pgp-key --from-file=your_pgp_key.asc

Step 3: Dockerfile
Here’s the Dockerfile that installs SOPS and GnuPG, and sets up the container to decrypt the secrets:

Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment YAML
Here’s the deployment configuration that mounts the secrets and runs the application:

Step 5: Build and Deploy
1.Build your Docker image:
docker build -t my-app .
2.Deploy to Kubernetes: Create the deployment using:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
